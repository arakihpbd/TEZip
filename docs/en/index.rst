Introduction
==============
This document describes the procedures for constructing the environment and operating procedures for the system developed in the "Development of Data Compression Tools for Maintenance and Utilization of Large-scale Research Facilities".

TEZip overview
==============

This system consisits of three mechanisms.

1. Learning mechanism
2. Compression mechanism
3. Decompression mechanism

 

Learning mechanism
``````````````````

`PredNet <https://coxlab.github.io/prednet/>`_ is used to learn the change in the movement of an object over time.
According to the learning method of PredNet, the learning data is converted into the hkl format and then learned.
The learned model is output to a file. This file is used by the compression mechanism and decompression mechanism.
Use another program to download the training data and convert it to hkl.

 

Compression mechanism
``````````````````````

Using the model output by the learning mechanism, the results of inference and difference of time series images are compressed.
After deriving the difference between the original image and the inference result,error-bounded quantization, Density-based Spatial Encoding, and Partitioned Entropy Encoding are processed. These processes have the effect of increasing the compression rate when compressing.
Use the zstd library to compress and output to a binary file (.dat).

And,differences and keyframe images are also output to a binary file (.dat) using the zstd library.

 

Decompression mechanism
`````````````````````````

Using the model output by the learning mechanism and the binary file (.dat) output by the compression mechanism, the image group input to the compression mechanism is restored.
By inferring by inputting keyframes, the inference result of the compression mechanism is reproduced.
The processing of Density-based Spatial Decoding and Partitioned Entropy Decoding is performed in the reverse order of the compression mechanism, and the original difference is restored.
Since the error-bounded quantization process is lossy compression, it is not included in the decompression mechanism.
The inference result and the difference are added to restore the original image and output it.

Operating environment
========
In this case, we used AWS EC2 to build the machine.

Environment construction procedure
============

Follow the steps below to build the environment.

* Install the NVIDIA driver
* Install CUDA
* Install cuDNN
* Create a virtual environment

Install the NVIDIA driver
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Follow the steps below to install the driver so that you can use NVIDIA's GPU.

Disable the standard driver
..........................
You need to turn off the standard driver so that it does not interfere with the installation of the NVIDIA driver. Please execute the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

  lsmod | grep nouveau
  
Then, use a text editor such as vim to create a file in the following directory.

.. code-block:: sh

   /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf

Write the following settings in the file you created and save it.

.. code-block:: sh

   blacklist nouveau
   options nouveau modeset=0
   
Then reboot and run the following command. If nothing is displayed, the disabling has been successful.

.. code-block:: sh

   lsmod | grep nouveau
   
Running the installation
..........................
Install the package required to install the NVIDIA driver. Execute the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

   yum -y install kernel-devel kernel-devel-$(uname -r) kernel-header-$(uname -r) gcc gcc-c++ make
  
Then, check the name of your GPU device. You can check it by running the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

   lspci | grep -i nvidia

From the`NVDIA driver download page <https://www.nvidia.co.jp/Download/index.aspx?lang=jp/>`_ as shown in the following figure, select your GPU device and proceed to installation.For **CUDA Toolkit**, please select **10.0**.

.. image:: ../img/img1.png

Next, run the downloaded file to run the NVIDIA driver installer.The following command is an example.Please replace the file name with the one you have downloaded and run it.

.. code-block:: sh

   sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-410.129-diagnostic.run
   
Select "YES" for all of the installer's selections to execute the installation.
The installation is complete when the screen shown in the following figure is displayed.

.. image:: ../img/img2.png

Execute the following command, and if the screen shown in the figure below is displayed, it has been installed correctly.
Select "YES" for all of the installer's selections to execute the installation.

.. code-block:: sh

   nvidia-smi

.. image:: ../img/img3.png

Install CUDA
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Install CUDA to use the GPU in your programs.
In this case, we will use the CUDA **10.0** version.
Open`the download page <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_distro=CentOS&target_version=7&target_type=rpmlocal>`_ shown in the figure below and select "Linux", "x86_64", "CentOS", "7", "rpm(local)" or "rpm(network)" to download the installer.

.. image:: ../img/img4.png

Next, run the downloaded file to run the CUDA 10.0 installer. Please run the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo yum -y install epel-release
   sudo rpm -i cuda-repo-rhel7-10-0-local-10.0.130-410.48-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
   yum clean all
   yum install cuda

Then, run the following command to pass it through. To reflect the result, please reboot after running it.

.. code-block:: sh

   echo ' PATH=”/usr/local/cuda-10.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=”/usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}"' >> ~/.bashrc

After rebooting, please execute the following command. If the screen shown in the figure below appears, the software has been installed correctly.

.. code-block:: sh

   nvcc -V

.. image:: ../img/img5.png

Install cuDNN
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Following CUDA, we will download cuDNN to use GPU in our programs.
You will need to create an NVIDIA account in advance. You may be asked to log in during the following procedure, so if you haven't created one, please do so at that time.
This time, we will use cuDNN **7.6.5** version.
Go to`the download page <https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive>`_ shown in the figure below and select "Download cuDNN v7.6.5 (November 5th, 2019), for CUDA 10.0" and "cuDNN Library for Linux" to download.

.. image:: ../img/img6.png

After the download is complete, unzip the file and place it in an appropriate location. Execute the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

   tar zxf cudnn-10.0-linux-x64-v7.6.5.32.tgz
   sudo cp -a cuda/include/* /usr/local/cuda/include/
   sudo cp -a cuda/lib64/* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
   sudo ldconfig

Create a virtual environment
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To separate the Python environment and make it easier to manage, we will use a virtual environment.
In this case, we will use "pyenv". We will install and use "anaconda" in it.


Install pyenv
..........................

Install pyenv and enable the "pyenv" command. Execute the following command and then reboot.

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
   echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

If you are using pyenv, use pip to install the library. This may involve unzipping the zip file, so if you do not have the zip command, you will need to install it. You can install it by running the following command

.. code-block:: sh

   yum -y install zip unzip bzip2
   
Install anaconda
..........................

Install anaconda in pyenv to create a virtual environment. You can run the command "pyenv install -l" to see a list of environments that can be installed. This time, we will use "anaconda3-4.3.1". The command to create a virtual environment is as shown below.

.. code-block:: sh

   eval "$(pyenv init -)"
   pyenv install anaconda3-4.3.1

After that, you can enter the virtual environment by executing the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

   pyenv rehash
   pyenv global anaconda3-4.3.1

Run the following command to check the version, and if you see the following message, you have entered the virtual environment.

.. code-block:: sh

   python -V
   Python 3.6.0 :: Anaconda 4.3.1 (64-bit)

Install the required libraries
..........................

After entering the environment with anaconda in pyenv, we will use pip to install the necessary libraries. First, update pip with the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install --upgrade pip
   
Next, run the following command to install the necessary libraries.

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.15
   pip install keras==2.2.4
   pip install hickle==4.0.1
   pip install numba==0.52.0
   pip install zstd==1.4.5.1
   pip install Pillow==8.0.1
   pip install scipy==1.2.0
   pip install h5py==2.10.0
   pip install cupy-cuda100==8.4.0
   pip install numpy==1.19.5

If you want to run the sample program for creating training data using Kitti data in the appendix, please install the following libraries additionally.

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install requests==2.25.1
   pip install bs4
   pip install imageio==2.9.0

If you run the following command and see "GPU" in the device_type field in the figure below, your Python program has successfully recognized the GPU.

.. code-block:: sh

   python
   # python interactive mode below
   >>> from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
   >>> device_lib.list_local_devices()

How to solve problems that occur during environment building
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Depending on the environment you are using, the previous steps may not work in some cases.
In this section, we will describe the problems we encountered while building the test environment and the solutions. If you encounter the same problem, please refer to this section.

When you run "pip install", you get an error and cannot install.
..........................

Depending on your permissions at runtime, you may get an error when you try to "pip install". This error occurs because you do not have permission to uninstall the previous version.
In this case, you can use the option "--ignore-installed" to ignore the dependency with the already installed library and install it.
An example of the command is shown below.

Cannot output files due to lack of file write permission
..........................

Depending on your permissions at runtime, you may not be able to output files from python in the virtual environment. In this case, you can run "sudo python" with administrator privileges to invoke python if it is installed outside the virtual environment.
In order to invoke python in the virtual environment from "sudo python", the following steps are required.

1. Open "/etc/sudoers" with a text editor such as vim.
2.  Add "[pyenv save location]/.pyenv" and "[pyenv save location]/.pyenv/bin" to "Default secure_path".
3.  If you are using vim, use ":wq!" to force a save, as you may get a warning and be unable to save.
4. Restart the system.

As an example of step 2, if you saved pyenv to "/home/pi", change as follows

# Before change

# After change

The GPU is recognized in Python interactive mode, but not when run in the console
..............................................................................

When running in python interactive mode, the GPU is recognized as shown in the following figure, but when executing the commands described in the next section, "Command Execution Examples and Arguments", it may be in "CPU MODE".
In this case, the NVIDIA driver may have been installed with wrong settings.
Please uninstall the NVIDIA driver and reinstall it again.
The command to uninstall the NVIDIA driver is as follows.


After executing the command, the GUI screen will appear as it did during installation, so follow the instructions to uninstall the software.
When installing again, use the installer downloaded in the section "Executing the Installation".
